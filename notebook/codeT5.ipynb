Otherwise, it will not be added to the Array.prototype.array.removeAll(element, true). Note that this method does not return an array, so it is not recommended to use it to remove elements from arrays. This method is only useful if you want to add an element to a list and then remove it from that list by calling the removeAll method on it. For more information, see Remove All Elements from a List. Returns: A list of all elements that have been removed. The elements are sorted by the order in which they were removed, with the first element being the last element removed and the second element the most recent element. Note: If you have multiple elements, you may need to call the Remove all method multiple times to ensure that all of them are removed at the same time. It is recommended that you only call it once for each element in your list, as this will cause an infinite loop. You can also use the deleteAll() method to delete a single element, which will remove all the remaining elements and return a new array that contains the removed elements. See also: Listing 11.1.2. Removing an Element From an Array Returns an empty array with no elements at all. An array is a collection of objects, each of which has its own set of properties. Each of these properties can be set to any value, and each property can have a value that is unique to that property. In this example, we have the following properties: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42\n"
